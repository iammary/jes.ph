The tag <meshBasicMaterial> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.
Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `transparent`.

If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: transparent="true" or transparent={value.toString()}.
The tag <mesh> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.
React does not recognize the `userData` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `userdata` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
