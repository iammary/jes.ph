- Prefer type inference for return types.
- Do not add manual return types to functions or components unless strictly necessary (e.g., to resolve complex inference issues).
- Avoid `@returns` in JSDoc for TypeScript code where the return type is easily inferrable.
- Use named exports instead of default exports.
- Use arrow functions for components and functions.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling as much as possible.
- Avoid global CSS classes; keep `globals.css` minimal and only for root-level styling.
